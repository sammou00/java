# Java Backend Development Course

## Course Overview

This 12 weeks course will introduce students to Java for backend development, with a focus on essential language concepts, database access using JPA, and building RESTful APIs using **Spring Boot**. By the end, students will be able to develop a basic, full-featured backend service.

---

## Week 8

### REST APIs with Spring Boot

- Introduction to RESTful Web Services
- Spring Boot REST Controllers (@RestController, @RequestMapping)
- Handling HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Validating Requests with @Valid

### Week 8 Task

- Query Methods and Custom Queries
- Database CRUD Operations via REST

### Week 9 Task

Integrate a database with the REST API and perform CRUD operations using Spring Data JPA.

---

## Week 10

### Security, Testing & Deployment

- Introduction to Spring Security (Authentication & Authorization)
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for Securing APIs
- Testing REST APIs (JUnit, MockMvc)
- Packaging and Deploying Spring Boot Applications

### Week 10 Task

Secure the REST API with Spring Security and JWT, then deploy it to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS.

## Week 11 & 12: Final Project â€“ Building a RESTful Web Service with User Authentication

### Project Overview

Students will develop a full-featured **Book Management System** that allows users to manage a library of books. The system will include user authentication, CRUD operations for managing books, and interaction with a database using Spring Data JPA. They will also secure the API using **Spring Security** and **JWT**, and deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku or AWS).

### Project Features

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement user registration and login using **Spring Security** and **JWT**.
   - Secure the API endpoints to ensure only authenticated users can access them.

2. **Book Management API**:
   - Create CRUD endpoints for managing books (adding, updating, deleting, and fetching book details).
   - Each book should have attributes like `title`, `author`, `isbn`, `publishedDate`, and `genre`.
   - Implement **pagination** and **filtering** for book lists.

3. **Database Integration**:
   - Use **Spring Data JPA** to store user and book data in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
   - Establish relationships between users and the books they manage.

4. **Validation**:
   - Validate request bodies for creating or updating books (e.g., checking required fields, valid ISBN format).

5. **Testing**:
   - Write unit and integration tests using **JUnit** and **MockMvc** for the API endpoints.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Package and deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., **Heroku** or **AWS**).
   - Configure environment variables and ensure the application runs in production mode.

### Week 11: Building Core Features

- Set up the Spring Boot project with required dependencies.
- Implement user registration and login with Spring Security and JWT.
- Build the book management API with CRUD functionality.
- Connect the application to a database and use Spring Data JPA to manage entities.

### Week 12: Testing, Security, and Deployment

- Add request validation for book management endpoints.
- Write unit and integration tests for the API.
- Implement security using Spring Security and JWT.
- Deploy the application to a cloud platform and ensure it's accessible online.
